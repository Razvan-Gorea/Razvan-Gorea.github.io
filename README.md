### 3rd Year Project Blog 2023/2024

*by Razvan Gorea and Sam Murphy*

### Introduction

This is a blog that goes through our developement journey of our 3rd Year Project. For some context, we decided on a web application, with the purpose being to help people find trails (hiking, walking and cycling) within the Republic of Ireland. We decided for the implementation to use React and Django. We planned to use the React web library to implement the user interface and the Django Python Framework to act as our server. Django would hold our trail data and then serve it to our React application when necessary. We knew we also wanted to integrate some of weather information via a weather API, as well as some additional pieces of information like points of interest which people could visit along their trail journeys. The weather information implementation would also be very important as it would help people plan ahead of time for their journeys. Preventing situations where a person goes on a trail and encounters bad weather.

### Stage 1

This is our earliest stage of development. During this period we decided on what our major objectives would be in terms of features and functionality. At this point we also agreed on how to split up the workload. Myself (Razvan) would create the frontend features and user interface and Sam would create the backend functionality, mainly through parsing necessary data as json to the Django backend. Then through the use of a Django REST API, custom endpoints would allow us to integrate the frontend with the backend. At this stage our biggest obstacles to overcome would be to figure out how to display the trail data and where we could get that kind of data to begin with. We concluded that we should both go off on our own and conduct some research to discover potential solutions.
