*by Razvan Gorea and Sam Murphy*

### Introduction

This is a blog that goes our developement journey for our 3rd Year Project. For some context, we decided on a web application, purpose being to help people to find trails (hiking, walking and cycling) within the Republic of Ireland. We decided for the implementation to be in React and Django. We planned to use the React web library to implement the user interface and the Django Python Framework to act as our server. Django would hold our trail data and then serve it to our React application when necessary. We knew we also wanted to integrate some of weather information via a weather API, as well as some additional pieces of information like points of interest which people could visit along their trail journeys. The weather information implementation would also be very important as it would help people better plan ahead of time. Preventing situations where a person goes on a trail and encounters bad weather.
